## Scivolema Sponsors

Scivolema project is open for any cooperation.

I'm not interested in the commercial side of the Web, just programming, so if you have any interest in sponsoring the project, or mutual development of the community/making Blogmasters app available as a commercial software, etc. we could discuss that.

There are more Web projects up the sleave, if you are interested in that kind of thing.
